# EVE Ship Flashcards

EVE Online has more than 300 different ship types. Learning the names and basic information about most of them is thus no small achievement. To make this easier, learning tools like flashcards can be used. Flashcards have helped many people in school and university, for things like vocabulary or math equations, and should prove equally useful for learning EVE's ships.

This project provides ready-made flash cards for the flashcard application [Anki][anki], as well as the tools neccessary to create them.
